# Overview

This project focuses on identifying the most visiting IP addresses from server logs. By analyzing the traffic data, we extract insights such as:

- The distribution of visits by IP.
- The most frequent visitors.
- Temporal patterns of requests.
- Outlier detection and potential security flags.

# Motivation

Understanding which IP addresses generate the most traffic can:
- Help in detecting suspicious or malicious activity.
- Optimize resource allocation and server load.
- Provide insights into user behavior and engagement patterns.

# Data

The analysis uses server log data which contains fields like:
- IP address
- Timestamp of visit
- Request details

# Analysis

1. **Data Acquisition:** Loading server logs from CSV or other structured file formats.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Filtering out incomplete or corrupt records.
3. **Aggregation:** Grouping records by IP addresses to count visits.
4. **Visualization:** Plotting the frequency distributions and trends over time.
5. **Insights:** Drawing conclusions regarding high-traffic IP addresses and discussing potential measures.

# Results

The analysis highlights:

A ranked list of IP addresses by visit count.

Visual trends showing traffic peaks and possible anomalies.

Suggestions for improving monitoring and security based on observed patterns.

Feel free to further explore the data or extend the analysis with more detailed statistics.
